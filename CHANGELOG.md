# Changelog

## [1.1.2] — 2026-07-17

### Changed
- **PAM hook now uses `/etc/pam.d/sudo_local` on macOS Sonoma+** (#23): Apple's
  sanctioned, unprotected include for local sudo PAM changes. This avoids editing
  the SIP-protected `/etc/pam.d/sudo` entirely — so activation can't fail with
  "Operation not permitted", removal is always possible (no Recovery Mode needed),
  and the hook survives macOS updates that reset `/etc/pam.d/sudo`. Older macOS
  without the `sudo_local` include falls back to editing `/etc/pam.d/sudo`
  directly, as before.
- Install/activate/uninstall PAM logic is unified in `scripts/pam-common.sh`;
  uninstall removes the hook before the module in all cases, including the new
  `sudo_local` path and the Homebrew cask.

### Docs
- setup.md and SECURITY.md document the `sudo_local` mechanism and a recovery
  path that works even when `/etc/pam.d/sudo` is protected.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- **sudo lockout on uninstall/upgrade** (#23): the Homebrew cask deleted the
  PAM module while leaving the `/etc/pam.d/sudo` reference, which made `sudo`
  unable to initialize PAM. Uninstall now restores the pam.d backup (or strips
  our line) before removing the module. Fixed the `depends_on macos:`
  deprecation warning.
- **BLE re-identify recovery on real devices** (#28, #29): restored
  CoreBluetooth connections are reconnected cleanly instead of reused with
  stale state; ECDH now starts only after service/characteristic readiness
  (replaces a fragile fixed delay); the daemon recovers a session when a
  session key arrives before the connect event. Pairing requests are sent from
  the same readiness gate. Thanks to @Souitou-iop for the fixes and the first
  real-iPhone verification.
- `ProximityMonitor` takes an injectable lock action so tests no longer sleep
  the developer's display.

### Security
- SECURITY.md documents the missing-module PAM availability failure mode and a
  recovery that works without sudo.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-04

### Pairing Security
- Pairing token from the QR payload is now **enforced end-to-end**: the daemon
  rejects any pairing request whose single-use token doesn't match the active
  5-minute pairing window (previously the token was generated but never validated)
- iOS app sends wire-format pair requests and reports "Paired" only after the
  Mac accepts; rejections show recovery instructions
- Paired devices are stored under their own device ID, fixing re-identify and
  challenge verification after reconnect

### QR Code Pairing
- `touchbridge-test pair` now renders the pairing payload as a QR code image
  and opens it automatically (deleted when pairing ends)
- iOS app: camera QR scanner as the primary pairing path; manual JSON entry
  remains as fallback

### Background Auth Notifications (iOS)
- Challenges arriving while the app is backgrounded now post a local
  notification; Face ID runs when the app is opened

### Daemon Hardening
- Shared session state is lock-protected (fixes data races under concurrent
  BLE callbacks)
- Pending-auth entries are cleaned up after each auth resolves; expired
  challenges and replay nonces are pruned every 60 seconds
- PAM socket timeout now exceeds the daemon auth window by 2s, so approvals
  landing at the deadline are no longer lost

### Distribution & Docs
- New `scripts/patch-pam.sh` — standalone PAM activation for Homebrew/pkg
  installs (docs previously pointed to a file that didn't exist)
- Release artifacts are versioned from the git tag
- Test suite: 127 Swift tests (111 daemon + 16 protocol) + 38-check e2e
  validation suite
